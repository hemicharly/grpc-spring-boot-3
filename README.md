# GRPC SPRING BOOT 3.2.x


This project has educational purposes, aiming to understand how gRPC works with Spring Boot. We implemented a simple calculator example, focusing on the core functionality. We chose to use the latest versions of dependencies, ensuring compatibility, and exploring the latest available features.

Throughout the development process, we paid special attention to error handling to enhance system robustness. We explored effective strategies for dealing with unexpected situations, ensuring a more reliable user experience. Additionally, we implemented detailed log tracing between applications, providing a clearer and more granular view of the execution flow.

By sharing this knowledge, we hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of some recommended practices when integrating gRPC with Spring Boot, offering valuable insights for developers looking to enhance their skills in this specific context.
